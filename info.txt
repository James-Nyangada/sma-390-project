Monthly Bill Optimizer - Getting Started

📌 Introduction

The Monthly Bill Optimizer is a Python-based project that helps users:
✅ Log and store monthly expenses
✅ Categorize expenses using Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)
✅ Optimize budget allocation using Linear Programming (PuLP)
✅ Visualize expense distribution with Seaborn & Matplotlib

This guide will help you set up, install dependencies, and run the project efficiently. It also includes essential Git commands to manage versions properly.

📂 Folder Structure

Ensure you have the following structure after cloning the repository:

📁 Monthly_Bill_Optimizer
│── main.py             # Main program entry point
│── data.py             # Handles user input & CSV storage
│── clustering.py       # Categorizes expenses using K-Means
│── optimization.py     # Budget optimization using Linear Programming
│── visualization.py    # Generates expense graphs
│── bills.csv           # Stores expense data (generated dynamically)
│── requirements.txt    # Lists required Python libraries

 Step 1: Clone the Project from GitHub

Run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:

git clone <repository_url> done
cd <file_name> done

Tip: Always create a new branch before making changes to prevent accidental data loss.

git checkout -b <branch_name>

 Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Check by running:

python --version or python -v

Install Required Dependencies

To install the necessary Python libraries, run:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn pulp statsmodels matplotlib seaborn

This installs:

pandas → Handles data storage & CSV processing

numpy → Supports numerical computations

scikit-learn → Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)

pulp → Optimization (Linear Programming)

matplotlib & seaborn → Data visualization
